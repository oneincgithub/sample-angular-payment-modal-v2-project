# Sample Angular Project with One Inc Payment Modal 2.0
This sample project will invoke the payment modal when the user clicks the Pay Now button. This project is for demonstration purposes only. For explicit contracts please refer to official documentation.

*NOTE:* Replace the 'one-inc-js' placeholder in 'index.html' file with the One Inc Js library CDN to runing the application.
- 'one-inc-js' - cdn endpoint which serves One Inc js library. See [index.html](https://github.com/oneincgithub/sample-angular-payment-modal-v2-project/blob/f0e4a1caebf8e4220f1b4ea560208117d14909f6/src/index.html#L12)

The constants file is where we set the authentication key and API base URL.
The instant-payment-component contains the Angular component for the Instant Payment card.  This is where the payment modal integration takes place.
index.html shows how to include the PortalOne library to the app.
